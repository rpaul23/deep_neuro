# deep_neuro
**deep_neuro**presents multiple ways of exploring the Gray dataset. At it's 
core, it features a convolutional neural network trying to predict either 
stimulus class or response type (CNN module). It also transforms the raw data 
from MATLAB to NumPy-ready and applies the usual pre-processing steps (matnpy
module) as well as dealing with the analysis and visualization of the results 
(monkeyplot module).

This readme will be appended shortly.
