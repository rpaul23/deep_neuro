# deep_neuro
**deep_neuro** presents multiple ways of exploring the Gray dataset. At it's 
core, it features a [convolutional neural network](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-99.pdf) 
trying to predict either stimulus class or response type from different brain 
regions and at different points in time (CNN module). It also transforms the raw 
data from MATLAB to NumPy-ready and applies the usual pre-processing steps 
([matnpy module](https://github.com/rpaul23/deep_neuro/tree/master/lib/matnpy)) 
as well as dealing with the analysis and visualization of the results 
([monkeyplot module](https://github.com/rpaul23/deep_neuro/tree/master/lib/monkeyplot)).

This readme will be appended shortly.
